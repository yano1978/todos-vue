## Authentication, Backend & Hosting

```
For user authentication's one reliable solution is Auth0, but JWT (JSON webtoken) is also powerful and easy to use. Website's backend could be developed using Laravel (PHP) and MYSQL or eventually SpringBoot (Java) and GraphQL.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) could be a solid and secure option, otherwise Azure Static Web Apps Service.
